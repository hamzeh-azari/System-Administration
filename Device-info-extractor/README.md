# Device Hardware Info Extractor (PowerShell)

A PowerShell script that extracts detailed hardware and system information from the local computer, including **device model**, **CPU type**, **BIOS version**, **serial number**, **Windows install date**, and optionally calculates the **approximate device age**.

---

## üß∞ Features

- Automatically **re-launches with admin privileges** if not already elevated
- Retrieves:
  - Device model
  - CPU model
  - Serial number
  - BIOS version
  - Windows OS install date
  - BIOS release date (if available)
- Calculates device age in years based on BIOS release date

---

## üì¶ Requirements

- PowerShell (Windows)
- Local execution privileges
- Admin rights (script enforces elevation)

---

## üöÄ Usage

1. Save the script as `Get-Device-Info.ps1`

2. Run it (double-click or PowerShell):
   ```powershell
   .\Get-Device-Info.ps1
   ```
3. The script will auto-prompt for admin access if not already elevated.
4. Output will display directly in the PowerShell console.

## üßæ Sample Script
```powershell

<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Extracts system hardware information and calculates approximate device age.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script collects hardware info including the device model, CPU, BIOS version, 
    serial number, and Windows installation date. If the BIOS release date is available, 
    it estimates the device's age. The script ensures it is run with administrator rights.
